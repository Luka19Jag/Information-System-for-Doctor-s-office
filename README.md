# Information-System-for-Doctor-s-office

This project was my thesis in college. The information system of the doctor's office was created.
The project was made in Java. A client-server application was created with the Singleton pattern implementation. The project is also connected to a database (relational database management system is MySQL). Some of the system operations that have been made are: scheduling, changing and deleting examinations: entering, changing and deleting patients and doctors: login and registration,...
Methods that have implemented REGEX expressions are important as a precaution against not entering the right things in text fields.
In addition, prior to developing the program, Object Relationship Models, Relational Models, Sequence Diagrams, Communication Diagrams, and so on were established in the documentation.
